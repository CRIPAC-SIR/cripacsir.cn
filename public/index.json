Unlike previous CNN-based methods, our framework incorporates Vision Transformer and CNN to extract complementary feature representations, which are beneficial to both subtasks. Specifically, for sclera segmentation, a novel two-stream hybrid model, referred to as Sclera-TransFuse-Seg, is developed to integrate classical ResNet-34 and recently emerging Swin Transformer encoders in parallel. The dual-encoders firstly extract coarse-and fine-grained feature representations at hierarchical stages, separately. Then a Cross-Domain Fusion (CDF) module based on information interaction and self-attention mechanism is introduced to efficiently fuse the multi-scale features extracted from dual-encoders. Finally, the fused features are progressively upsampled and aggregated to predict the sclera masks in the decoder meanwhile deep supervision strategies are employed to learn intermediate feature representations better and faster. With the results of sclera segmentation, the sclera ROI image is generated for sclera feature extraction. Additionally, a new sclera recognition model, termed as Sclera-TransFuse-Rec, is proposed by combining lightweight EfficientNet B0 and multi-scale Vision Transformer in sequential to encode local and global sclera vasculature feature representations. Extensive experiments on several publicly available databases suggest that our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on various sclera segmentation and recognition benchmarks, including the 8th Sclera Segmentation and Recognition Benchmarking Competition (SSRBC 2023).

Pixels within these areas are difficult to semantically distinguish since they have similar visual characteristics and close spatial positions. To tackle this problem, the paper proposes an iris segmentation graph neural network (ISeGraph) for accurate segmentation. ISeGraph regards individual pixels as nodes within the graph and constructs self-adaptive edges according to multi-faceted knowledge, including visual similarity, positional correlation, and semantic consistency for feature aggregation. Specifically, visual similarity strengthens the connections between nodes sharing similar visual characteristics, while positional correlation assigns weights according to the spatial distance between nodes. In contrast to the above knowledge, semantic consistency maps nodes into a semantic space and learns pseudo-labels to define relationships based on label consistency. ISeGraph leverages multi-faceted knowledge to generate self-adaptive relationships for accurate iris segmentation. Furthermore, a pixel-wise adaptive normalization module is developed to increase the feature discriminability. It takes informative features in the shallow layer as a reference to improve the segmentation features from a statistical perspective. Experimental results on three iris datasets illustrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in iris segmentation, increasing the segmentation accuracy in areas near the iris boundaries.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Faceted Knowledge-Driven Graph Neural Network for Iris Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"1. Boosting multi-modal ocular recognition via spatial feature reconstruction and unsupervised image quality estimation Zihui Yan, Lingxiao He, Yunlong Wang, Kunbo Zhang, Zhenan Sun, Tieniu Tan. \u0026ldquo;Boosting multi-modal ocular recognition via spatial feature reconstruction and unsupervised image quality estimation\u0026rdquo;. Machine Intelligence Research (Volume: 21).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11633-023-1415-y\nIn the daily application of an iris-recognition-at-a-distance (IAAD) system, many ocular images of low quality are acquired. As the iris part of these images is often not qualified for the recognition requirements, the more accessible periocular regions are a good complement for recognition. To further boost the performance of IAAD systems, a novel end-to-end framework for multi-modal ocular recognition is proposed. The proposed framework mainly consists of iris/periocular feature extraction and matching, unsupervised iris quality assessment, and a score-level adaptive weighted fusion strategy. First, ocular feature reconstruction (OFR) is proposed to sparsely reconstruct each probe image by high-quality gallery images based on proper feature maps. Next, a brand new unsupervised iris quality assessment method based on random multiscale embedding robustness is proposed. Different from the existing iris quality assessment methods, the quality of an iris image is measured by its robustness in the embedding space. At last, the fusion strategy exploits the iris quality score as the fusion weight to coalesce the complementary information from the iris and periocular regions. Extensive experimental results on ocular datasets prove that the proposed method is obviously better than unimodal biometrics, and the fusion strategy can significantly improve the recognition performance.\n2.

Machine Intelligence Research (Volume: 21).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s11633-022-1402-8\nIris biometrics is a phenotypic biometric trait that has proven to be agnostic to human natural physiological changes. Research on iris biometrics has progressed tremendously, partly due to publicly available iris databases. Various databases have been available to researchers that address pressing iris biometric challenges such as constraint, mobile, multispectral, synthetics, long-distance, contact lenses, liveness detection, etc. However, these databases mostly contain subjects of Caucasian and Asian docents with very few Africans. Despite many investigative studies on racial bias in face biometrics, very few studies on iris biometrics have been published, mainly due to the lack of racially diverse large-scale databases containing sufficient iris samples of Africans in the public domain. Furthermore, most of these databases contain a relatively small number of subjects and labelled images. This paper proposes a large-scale African database named Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation (CASIA)-Iris-Africa that can be used as a complementary database for the iris recognition community to mediate the effect of racial biases on Africans. The database contains 28 717 images of 1 023 African subjects (2 046 iris classes) with age, gender, and ethnicity attributes that can be useful in demographically sensitive studies of Africans. Sets of specific application protocols are incorporated with the database to ensure the database’s variability and scalability. Performance results of some open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms on the database are presented, which will serve as baseline performances. The relatively poor performances of the baseline algorithms on the proposed database despite better performance on other databases prove that racial biases exist in these iris recognition algorithms.\n3.

IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security ( Volume: 19).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2024.3407508\nAccurate iris segmentation, especially around the iris inner and outer boundaries, is still a formidable challenge. Pixels within these areas are difficult to semantically distinguish since they have similar visual characteristics and close spatial positions. To tackle this problem, the paper proposes an iris segmentation graph neural network (ISeGraph) for accurate segmentation. ISeGraph regards individual pixels as nodes within the graph and constructs self-adaptive edges according to multi-faceted knowledge, including visual similarity, positional correlation, and semantic consistency for feature aggregation. Specifically, visual similarity strengthens the connections between nodes sharing similar visual characteristics, while positional correlation assigns weights according to the spatial distance between nodes. In contrast to the above knowledge, semantic consistency maps nodes into a semantic space and learns pseudo-labels to define relationships based on label consistency. ISeGraph leverages multi-faceted knowledge to generate self-adaptive relationships for accurate iris segmentation. Furthermore, a pixel-wise adaptive normalization module is developed to increase the feature discriminability. It takes informative features in the shallow layer as a reference to improve the segmentation features from a statistical perspective. Experimental results on three iris datasets illustrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in iris segmentation, increasing the segmentation accuracy in areas near the iris boundaries.\n","date":1718323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718323200,"objectID":"0d5e305222a17709c78acfda1445eed3","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/post/recent-published-papers-24/","publishdate":"2024-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/recent-published-papers-24/","section":"post","summary":"Boosting multi-modal ocular recognition via spatial feature reconstruction and unsupervised image quality estimation, CASIA-Iris-Africa: A Large-scale African Iris Image Database, Multi-Faceted Knowledge-Driven Graph Neural Network for Iris Segmentation","tags":["smart iris recognition"],"title":"Two paper were accepted to Mahcine Intelligence Research (MIR) and another one was accpeted to TIFS 2024","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zihui Yan","Lingxiao He","Yunlong Wang","Kunbo Zhang","Zhenan Sun","Tieniu Tan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1705276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705276800,"objectID":"fc70d4362ace9b847998f1ccaae0fe8c","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/yan-mir-2024-1/","publishdate":"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yan-mir-2024-1/","section":"publication","summary":"In the daily application of an iris-recognition-at-a-distance (IAAD) system, many ocular images of low quality are acquired.

In this work, we propose an end-to-end method named Personalized Graph Generation (PGG) to construct the geometry-aware graph from an intermediate predicted human mesh. Specifically, a convolutional module initially regresses a coarse SMPL mesh tailored for each sample. Guided by the 3D structure of this personalized mesh, PGG extracts the local features from the 2D feature map. Then, these geometry-aware features are integrated with the specific coarse SMPL parameters as vertex features. Furthermore, a body-oriented adjacency matrix is adaptively generated according to the coarse mesh. It considers individual full-body relations between vertices, enhancing the perception of body geometry. Finally, a graph attentional module is utilized to predict the residuals to get the final results.

It is particularly challenging as this has created a research blind spot for African cohorts in these databases. Despite many of the reported investigative studies on racial bias in face biometrics, very few iris racial bias-related studies have been published, which can be due to the insufficient number of other races databases such as the Africans. Recently, face recognition algorithms have been reported to be biased toward specific demographics. Most prominently, many investigative studies have reported higher false-positive rates in African subject cohorts than in other cohorts. Due to the unavailability of the required quantity of African cohorts in the publicly available iris databases, similar studies would be difficult to replicate on iris biometrics. We presents a mainly African dataset that can be useful in addressing some of these challenges.\nDescription The iris images were captured in Nigeria, Africa. The capturing exercise was conducted across various locations in multiple sessions over three months. Due to logistical constraints, the capturing exercise was limited to the northern part of Nigeria. Each subject volunteer was asked to sign a consent form authorizing the data to be used for only research purposes. The iris sensor device for capturing the images is the IKUSBE30 iris sensor from IrisKing. The setup for the capturing exercise is shown in Fig. 1. Each volunteer was asked to hold the device, standing or sitting, based on their preference. As such, the iris images were captured at various degrees of head postures.\nFig. 1: Iris Capturing set-ups (indoor and outdoor)\nThe procedure for image capturing is in two steps:\nStep 1: Straight Gaze Capture: In this step, the volunteer was asked to hold the sensor and gaze into its lenses while moving the eyes in small ranges to the left, right, up, or down for approximately 3 minutes. During this time, images were periodically captured automatically at constant intervals. The eye movement ensures that the iris position and orientation are highly diversified across the captured images. Samples of the captured images in this step are shown in Fig. 2 (left). Step 2: Open-Close Capture: In this step, the volunteer was asked to open and close the eyes while gazing into the device for approximately 3 minutes. The iris images were automatically captured within this period. The essence of the opening and closing of the eyes is to ensure that the images contain irises of various sizes and degrees of occlusion, from fully closed eyes to half open and fully open eyes. This procedure will ultimately improve image diversity. Exemplary samples are shown in Fig. 2 (right). Fig. 2: Exemplary samples of captured images in Step 1 (left image) and Step 2 (right image)\nAfter the capturing sessions, the stored images were processed. The processing steps comprise automatic image selection to discard images with duplicate content, followed by manual image selection that guarantees the selected images\u0026rsquo; reliability. In the automatic selection, all the images from a single eye of one subject were organized into a matrix, with each column representing an image. The images of the subject\u0026rsquo;s eyes were then processed, and duplicates were removed using this procedure. The remaining images were then manually processed. The manual selection involves one-by-one human inspection of each image to identify damaged images and those images with no irises captured in them. Some sample images of one subject from the generated dataset are shown in Fig. 3, the labelled sampled images in Fig. 4, the summary of the database is presented in Table 1 and the database subjects\u0026rsquo; age distribution is shown in Fig. 5.\nFig. 3: Samples of one subject left iris (upper two rows) and (b) right iris (lower two rows)\nFig. 4: Labelled iris mask, inner and outer circle superimposed on respective samples in Fig. 3 for (a) left iris (upper two rows) and (b) right iris (lower two rows)\nTab. 1: Summary of the generated database Fig. 5: Age distribution of the generated database\nDatabase Organization The database package comprises of the following components organised in multiple directories:\nimage folder: This contain the iris images. Each image is named with SubjectID_Eye_ImageNumber.jpg. That represents: SubjectID: a unique number for each subject Eye is a letter that can be either “L” for left eye or “R” for right eye ImageNumber is a sequential number for images for the same subject iris_edge folder: This contain the corresponding 1-pixel iris edge binary images iris_edge_mask folder: This contain the corresponding iris binary masks of the images pupil_edge folder: This contain the corresponding 1-pixel pupil edge binary images pupil_edge_mask folder: This contain the corresponding pupil binary masks of the images params folder: This contain the corresponding ini files that describes radius and orientation both the iris and pupil used in the generation of iris edge, iris mask, pupil edge, pupil and mask images Protocols folder: This contain the files named with each of the defined proposed protocols. Each of the files contains list of all the images allowed to be used for that protocol which are categorised as either Training, Testing, Target or Query as described in the database paper.

Moreover, to boost the iris recognition performance, we introduce a triplet loss to push away the distance of super-resolved iris images with different IDs, and pull the distance of super-resolved iris images with the same ID much closer.

These microstructures make the human iris informative biometric traits. To learn identity representation from them, this paper regards each iris region as a potential microstructure and proposes contextual measures (CM) to model the correlations between them. CM adopts two parallel branches to learn global and local contexts in iris image. The first one is the globally contextual measure branch. It measures the global context involving the relationships between all regions for feature aggregation and is robust to local occlusions. Besides, we improve its spatial perception considering the positional randomness of the microstructures. The other one is the locally contextual measure branch. This branch considers the role of local details in the phenotypic distinctiveness of iris patterns and learns a series of relationship atoms to capture contextual information from a local perspective. In addition, we develop the perturbation bottleneck to make sure that the two branches learn divergent contexts. It introduces perturbation to limit the information flow from input images to identity features, forcing CM to learn discriminative contextual information for iris recognition. Experimental results suggest that global and local contexts are two different clues critical for accurate iris recognition.

Many investigative studies have been published on estimating the bias between Caucasians and Asians, Caucasians and Africans, and other racial comparisons. These studies have reported inferior performances of both Asians and Africans when compared to other races. However, very few studies have highlighted the comparative differences in performance as a function of race between Africans and Asians. More so, those previous studies were mainly concentrated on a single aspect of facial biometrics and were usually conducted with images potentially captured with multiple camera sensors, thereby compounding their findings. This paper presents a comparative racial bias study of Asians with Africans on various facial biometric tasks.

A considerable amount of work has been done on this topic across different biometric modalities, aiming at better understanding the main sources of algorithmic bias or devising mitigation measures. In this work, we contribute to these efforts and present the first study investigating bias and fairness of sclera segmentation models. Although sclera segmentation techniques represent a key component of sclera-based biometric systems with a considerable impact on the overall recognition performance, the presence of different types of biases in sclera segmentation methods is still underexplored. To address this limitation, we describe the results of a group evaluation effort (involving seven research groups), organized to explore the performance of recent sclera segmentation models within a common experimental framework and study performance differences (and bias), originating from various demographic as well as environmental factors. Using five diverse datasets, we analyze seven independently developed sclera segmentation models in different experimental configurations. The results of our experiments suggest that there are significant differences in the overall segmentation performance across the seven models and that among the considered factors, ethnicity appears to be the biggest cause of bias. Additionally, we observe that training with representative and balanced data does not necessarily lead to less biased results. Finally, we find that in general there appears to be a negative correlation between the amount of bias observed (due to eye color, ethnicity and acquisition device) and the overall segmentation performance, suggesting that advances in the field of semantic segmentation may also help with mitigating bias.","tags":["Sclera Segmentation"],"title":"Exploring Bias in Sclera Segmentation Models: A Group Evaluation Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunlong Wang","Mupei Li","Zhengquan Luo","Zhenan Sun"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1665648725,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665648725,"objectID":"ce82012fe5faffbfe5a0730f1b3118fe","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/wang-ijcb-2022/","publishdate":"2022-10-13T08:58:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-ijcb-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Light Field Focal Stack (LFFS) can be efficiently rendered from a light field (LF) image captured by plenoptic cameras. Differences in the 3D surface and texture of biometric samples are internally reflected in the defocus blur and local patterns between the rendered slices of LFFS. This unique property makes LFFS quite appropriate to differentiate presentation attack instruments (PAIs) from bona fide samples. A patch-based dual-view network (PDVN) is proposed in this paper to leverage the merits of LFFS for face presentation attack detection (PAD). First, original LFFS data are divided into various local patches along spatial dimensions, which distracts the model from learning the useless facial semantics and greatly relieve the problem of insufficient samples. The strategy of dual-view branches is innovatively proposed, wherein the original view and microscopic view can simultaneously contribute to liveness detection. Separable 3D convolution on the focal dimension is verified to be more effective than vanilla 3D convolution for extracting discriminative features from LFFS data. The voting mechanism on predictions of patch LFFS samples further strengthens the robustness of the proposed framework.

To curb these attacks, most defense methods aim to improve the robustness of recognition models against adversarial perturbations. However, the generalization capacities of these methods are quite limited. In practice, they are still vulnerable to unseen adversarial attacks. Deep learning models are fairly robust to general perturbations, such as Gaussian noises. A straightforward approach is to inactivate the adversarial perturbations so that they can be easily handled as general perturbations. In this paper, a plug-and-play adversarial defense method, named perturbation inactivation (PIN), is proposed to inactivate adversarial perturbations for adversarial defense. We discover that the perturbations in different subspaces have different influences on the recognition model. There should be a subspace, called the immune space, in which the perturbations have fewer adverse impacts on the recognition model than in other subspaces. Hence, our method estimates the immune space and inactivates the adversarial perturbations by restricting them to this subspace. The proposed method can be generalized to unseen adversarial perturbations since it does not rely on a specific kind of adversarial attack method. This approach not only outperforms several state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods but also demonstrates a superior generalization capacity through exhaustive experiments. Moreover, the proposed method can be successfully applied to four commercial APIs without additional training, indicating that it can be easily generalized to existing face recognition systems.","tags":["Face Recognition","Adversarial Defense"],"title":"Perturbation Inactivation Based Adversarial Defense for Face Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Zhengquan Luo, Yunlong Wang*, Zilei Wang, Zhenan Sun, Tieniu Tan.

In the acquisition process, various inevitable factors, including eyes, devices, and environment, hinder the iris recognition system from learning a discriminative identity representation. This leads to severe performance degradation. In this paper, we explore uncertain acquisition factors and propose uncertainty embedding (UE) and uncertainty-guided curriculum learning (UGCL) to mitigate the influence of acquisition factors. UE represents an iris image using a probabilistic distribution rather than a deterministic point (binary template or feature vector) that is widely adopted in iris recognition methods. Specifically, UE learns identity and uncertainty features from the input image, and encodes them as two independent components of the distribution, mean and variance. Based on this representation, an input image can be regarded as an instantiated feature sampled from the UE, and we can also generate various virtual features through sampling. UGCL is constructed by imitating the progressive learning process of newborns. Particularly, it selects virtual features to train the model in an easy-to-hard order at different training stages according to their uncertainty. In addition, an instance-level enhancement method is developed by utilizing local and global statistics to mitigate the data uncertainty from image noise and acquisition conditions in the pixel-level space. The experimental results on six benchmark iris datasets verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method on same-sensor and cross-sensor recognition.\nGithub repository： https://github.com/reborn20200813/uncertainty\nMultitask deep active contour-based iris segmentation for off-angle iris images Tianhao Lu, Caiyong Wang, Yunlong Wang, and Zhenan Sun \u0026ldquo;Multitask deep active contour-based iris segmentation for off-angle iris images,\u0026rdquo; Journal of Electronic Imaging 31(4), 041211 (26 February 2022).\nIris recognition has been considered as a secure and reliable biometric technology. However, iris images are prone to off-angle or are partially occluded when captured with fewer user cooperations. As a consequence, iris recognition especially iris segmentation suffers a serious performance drop. To solve this problem, we propose a multitask deep active contour model for off-angle iris image segmentation. Specifically, the proposed approach combines the coarse and fine localization results. The coarse localization detects the approximate position of the iris area and further initializes the iris contours through a series of robust preprocessing operations. Then, iris contours are represented by 40 ordered isometric sampling polar points and thus their corresponding offset vectors are regressed via a convolutional neural network for multiple times to obtain the precise inner and outer boundaries of the iris. Next, the predicted iris boundary results are regarded as a constraint to limit the segmentation range of noise-free iris mask. Besides, an efficient channel attention module is introduced in the mask prediction to make the network focus on the valid iris region.

In the acquisition process, various inevitable factors, including eyes, devices, and environment, hinder the iris recognition system from learning a discriminative identity representation. This leads to severe performance degradation. In this paper, we explore uncertain acquisition factors and propose uncertainty embedding (UE) and uncertainty-guided curriculum learning (UGCL) to mitigate the influence of acquisition factors. UE represents an iris image using a probabilistic distribution rather than a deterministic point (binary template or feature vector) that is widely adopted in iris recognition methods. Specifically, UE learns identity and uncertainty features from the input image, and encodes them as two independent components of the distribution, mean and variance. Based on this representation, an input image can be regarded as an instantiated feature sampled from the UE, and we can also generate various virtual features through sampling. UGCL is constructed by imitating the progressive learning process of newborns. Particularly, it selects virtual features to train the model in an easy-to-hard order at different training stages according to their uncertainty. In addition, an instance-level enhancement method is developed by utilizing local and global statistics to mitigate the data uncertainty from image noise and acquisition conditions in the pixel-level space. The experimental results on six benchmark iris datasets verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method on same-sensor and cross-sensor recognition.","tags":["smart iris recognition"],"title":"Towards More Discriminative and Robust Iris Recognition by Learning Uncertain Factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianhao Lu","Caiyong Wang","Yunlong Wang","Zhenan Sun"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1645085525,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645085525,"objectID":"60c7238771ee6a050174eaf1179b49a2","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/lu-jei-2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-17T08:58:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lu-jei-2022/","section":"publication","summary":" Iris recognition has been considered as a secure and reliable biometric technology. However, iris images are prone to off-angle or are partially occluded when captured with fewer user cooperations. As a consequence, iris recognition especially iris segmentation suffers a serious performance drop. To solve this problem, we propose a multitask deep active contour model for off-angle iris image segmentation. Specifically, the proposed approach combines the coarse and fine localization results. The coarse localization detects the approximate position of the iris area and further initializes the iris contours through a series of robust preprocessing operations. Then, iris contours are represented by 40 ordered isometric sampling polar points and thus their corresponding offset vectors are regressed via a convolutional neural network for multiple times to obtain the precise inner and outer boundaries of the iris. Next, the predicted iris boundary results are regarded as a constraint to limit the segmentation range of noise-free iris mask. Besides, an efficient channel attention module is introduced in the mask prediction to make the network focus on the valid iris region. A differentiable, fast, and efficient SoftPool operation is also used in place of traditional pooling to keep more details for more accurate pixel classification.

Most Re-ID methods formulate it as visual representation learning and image search, and its accuracy is consequently affected greatly by the search space. Spatial-temporal information has been proven to be efficient to filter irrelevant negative samples and significantly improve Re-ID accuracy. However, existing spatial-temporal person Re-ID methods are still rough and do not exploit spatial-temporal information sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level and spatial-temporal disentangled Re-ID method (InSTD), to improve Re-ID accuracy. In our proposed framework, personalized information such as moving direction is explicitly considered to further narrow down the search space. Besides, the spatial-temporal transferring probability is disentangled from joint distribution to marginal distribution, so that outliers can also be well modeled. Abundant experimental analyses on two datasets are presented, which demonstrates the superiority and provides more insights into our method. The proposed method achieves mAP of 90.8% on Market-1501 and 89.1% on DukeMTMC-reID, improving from the baseline 82.2% and 72.7%, respectively.

In cross-spectral iris recognition, there exist distinct device-specific bands between near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) images, resulting in the distribution gap between samples from different spectra and thus severe degradation in recognition performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a new cross-spectral iris recognition method to learn spectral-invariant features by estimating device-specific bands. In the proposed method, Gabor Trident Network (GTN) first utilizes the Gabor function’s priors to perceive iris textures under different spectra, and then codes the device-specific band as the residual component to assist the generation of spectral-invariant features. By investigating the device-specific band, GTN effectively reduces the impact of device-specific bands on identity features. Besides, we make three efforts to further reduce the distribution gap. First, Spectral Adversarial Network (SAN) adopts a class-level adversarial strategy to align feature distributions. Second, Sample-Anchor (SA) loss upgrades triplet loss by pulling samples to their class center and pushing away from other class centers. Third, we develop a higher-order alignment loss to measures the distribution gap according to space bases and distribution shapes.

The appr-circle fitting can not meet the needs due to the high time cost and non-accurate boundary estimation during the normalization process. Furthermore, the appr-circular hypothesis of iris and pupil is not entirely established due to the squint and occlusion in non-cooperative environments. To mitigate this problem, a multi-mask normalization without appr-circular parameter estimation is proposed to make full use of the segmented masks, which provide robust pixel-level iris boundaries. It bridges the segmentation and feature extraction to recognize the low-quality iris, which is thrown directly by the traditional methods. Thus, the complex samples with no appr-circular iris or massive occlusions can be recognized correctly.

These images exhibit partial occlusions due to eyelids and eyelashes, specular reflections, and severe deformations caused by pupil dilations and contractions. Recognizing these low-quality images is a challenging yet dominant problem in IAAD. To mitigate this issue, current iris recognition systems mostly filter out low-quality images by using strict criteria based on image quality evaluation. This strategy, however, wastes device capabilities and produces low throughput of subjects. Other systems require highly cooperative users. In this work, we propose a novel occlusion-robust, deformation-robust, and alignment-free framework for low-quality iris matching, which integrates the merits of deep features and sparse representation in an end-to-end learning process known as iris spatial feature reconstruction (ISFR). Here each probe image can be sparsely reconstructed on the basis of appropriate feature maps from gallery high-quality images. ISFR uses the error from robust reconstruction over spatial pyramid features to measure similarities between two iris images, which naturally avoids the time-consuming alignment step. In summary, the distinctiveness of deep features, the robustness of sparse reconstruction, and the flexibility of multiscale matching strategy are unified in a general framework to attain more accurate and reasonable iris matching. Extensive experimental results on four public iris image databases demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms both traditional and deep learning-based iris recognition methods.","tags":["smart iris recognition"],"title":"Flexible Iris Matching Based on Spatial Feature Reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junxing Hu","Leyuan Wang","Zhengquan Luo","Yunlong Wang","Zhenan Sun"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1628323925,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628323925,"objectID":"6e7419464e96c98403a8272e692fdf9c","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/hu-ijcb-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-07T08:58:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hu-ijcb-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, iris recognition has been used increasingly as contactless and unaffected by face masks.

All images were collected under NIR illumination and two eyes were captured simultaneously. Details of the proposed database are shown in the table below. Setup of image collection As shown in the figure below, we built a collection room using black-out cloth. The curtain on one side of the room can be opened and closed artificially to control the natural light. Inside, there were camera (A), light sources (B, C), volunteer (D), and four directional markers (1-4). Each volunteer was asked to sit down, put their chin on the holder (0.75 m from the camera), keep their head as still as possible, and move their eyes according to instructions. To simulate the off-angle situation, the subject was required to look along a set of directions indicated by four markers in the visual field, while in other cases look straight ahead (i.e., the midpoint of marker 1 and 4). Statistics of the proposed database To simulate real image degradation, the proposed database is divided into four categories, and each of them is separated into three to five subsets as follows:\nIllumination The intensity of the VW light source was adjusted to four levels: Dark (0%), Weak (25%), Medium (50%), Strong (100%) to change the pupil size. In addition, images under natural light were also collected (with Dark level). Note that the intensity in other categories was set to the Medium level by default.\nOff-angle There are four directions: (1) Left, (2) Upper left, (3) Upper right, (4) Right. The left and right are in the horizontal direction, while the upper left and right angles are both 45 degrees.\nNonideal eye state Since it is difficult to keep eyes open all the time, we collected images of closed, squinted, and half-open eyes. Although most images of the former two classes have no effective iris region and are accompanied by blur, they can be used to train eye state detectors for fatigue driving detection or other relevant scenarios.\nOcclusion For occlusion, volunteers were required to wear glasses, masks and using a hand to cover the mouth and nose. During this section, the NIR light source was randomly moved slightly to generate light spots. Meanwhile, some glasses also had stains on the surface to occlude the iris. An unexpected observation is that for some elderly volunteers, their eyelids droop naturally, resulting in severe occlusion, which should arouse more attention.\nMore samples and annotations are presented below.

However, racial bias had been proven to be inherent in most State Of The Art (SOTA) face recognition systems. Many investigative studies on face recognition algorithms have reported higher false positive rates of African subjects cohorts than the other cohorts. Lack of large-scale African face image databases in public domain is one of the main restrictions in studying the racial bias problem of face recognition. To this end, we collect a face image database namely CASIA-Face-Africa which contains 38,546 images of 1,183 African subjects. Multi-spectral cameras are utilized to capture the face images under various illumination settings. Demographic attributes and facial expressions of the subjects are also carefully recorded. For landmark detection, each face image in the database is manually labeled with 68 facial keypoints. A group of evaluation protocols are constructed according to different applications, tasks, partitions and scenarios. The performances of SOTA face recognition algorithms without re-training are reported as baselines. The proposed database along with its face landmark annotations, evaluation protocols and preliminary results form a good benchmark to study the essential aspects of face biometrics for African subjects, especially face image preprocessing, face feature analysis and matching, facial expression recognition, sex/age estimation, ethnic classification, face image generation, etc. The database can be downloaded from our website.","tags":["smart iris recognition"],"title":"CASIA-Face-Africa: A Large-Scale African Face Image Database","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leyuan Wang","Kunbo Zhang","Yunlong Wang","Zhenan Sun"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1623715925,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623715925,"objectID":"b95859f772a8ca6e0881f96403be7716","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/wang-ijcb-2021/","publishdate":"2021-06-15T08:58:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-ijcb-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"For distant iris recognition, a long focal length lens is generally used to ensure the resolution of iris images, which reduces the depth of field and leads to potential defocus blur. To accommodate users at different distances, it is necessary to control focus quickly and accurately. While for users in motion, it is expected to maintain the correct focus on the iris area continuously. In this paper, we introduced a novel rapid autofocus camera for active refocusing of the iris area of the moving objects using a focus-tunable lens. Our end-to-end computational algorithm can predict the best focus position from one single blurred image and generate the proper lens diopter control signal automatically. This scene-based active manipulation method enables real-time focus tracking of the iris area of a moving object. We built a testing bench to collect real-world focal stacks for evaluation of the autofocus methods. Our camera has reached an autofocus speed of over 50 fps.

Introduction A key problem of iris recognition at a distance is that a large portion of captured iris images is nonideal because of narrow depth of field (DoF), noncooperative user movement, incongruous exposure time and so on. Current iris recognition systems usually filter out these low-quality images using strict criteria of image quality evaluation (IQA). However, this strategy inevitably leads to a waste of device capacity and low throughput. Therefore, a better and practical solution is to make the utmost of degraded iris images for personal identification. We announce the availability of a long-range captured dataset containing 3,756 iris images of various degradation factors from 98 subjects. An evaluation benchmark is built upon the dataset for a comparative study on preprocessing and recognition of NIR iris images in high-throughput scenarios. The datasets, manual annotations and evaluation toolkit are publicly available.\n2. Descriptions and Statistics of the Database Image collection The schematic and setup of blur-varying iris image collection of this database at a distance are shown as following.\nThe next generation of CASIA-LR-Cam bundled with NIR illumination at a wavelength of 830 nm was employed as the capturing device. Its standoff distance is approximately 1.2 meters with a DoF of over 20 centimeters. The field of view (FoV) is approximately 20 degrees. The device was placed in an indoor environment under no extra lighting sources. During the process of image collection, the subjects were obliged to move freely in the restricted square area 1.0~1.4 meters away from the device. Specifically, they could casually step forward and backward, left and right.\nWhile moving inside the restricted area, the subjects were guided by the indication signal on the GUI screen to look at different directions for approximately 30 seconds in a single session. Two separate sessions were launched in the daytime under the same conditions, and the interval was one week.

To investigate recent developments and attract more interests of researchers in the iris segmentation method, we are planning to host the challenge competition. In this challenge, we aim to benchmark the performance of iris segmentation on NIR iris images from Asian and African people captured in non-cooperative environments. Moreover, we specially split the general iris segmentation task in the conventional iris recognition pipeline into the segmentation of noise-free iris mask and the localization of inner and outer boundaries of the iris, which are narrowly referred to as iris segmentation and iris localization.

The reflection of the spectacles usually contaminates the iris image acquired under infrared illumination. The intense light reflection caused by the active light source makes reflection removal more challenging than normal scenes since important iris texture features are entirely obscured. Eliminating unnecessary reflections can effectively improve iris recognition system performance. This paper proposes a spectacle reflection removal algorithm based on ray coding and ray tracking to remove spectacle reflection in iris images. By decoding the light source’s encoded light beam, the iris imaging device eliminates most of the stray light. Our binocular imaging device tracks the light path to obtain parallax information and realizes reflected light spot removal through image fusion. We designed a prototype system to verify our proposed method in this paper. This method can effectively eliminate reflections without changing iris texture and improve iris recognition in complex scenarios.","tags":["smart iris recognition"],"title":"Avoiding Spectacles Reflections on Iris Images Using A Ray-tracing Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiwei Ru","Wanting Zhou","Yunfan Liu","Jianxin Sun","Qi Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617783125,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617783125,"objectID":"c114a41d934a853d7fe7a2e06f4b36d0","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/yiwei-ru-ijcb-2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-07T08:58:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yiwei-ru-ijcb-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep forgery detection on video data has attracted remarkable research attention in recent years due to its potential in defending forgery attacks. However, existing methods either only focus on the visual evidence within individual images, or are too sensitive to fluctuations across frames. To address these issues, this paper propose a novel model, named Bita-Net, to detect forgery faces in video data. The network design of Bita-Net is inspired by the mechanism of how human beings detect forgery data, i.e. browsing and scrutinizing, which is reflected by the two-pathway architecture of Bita-Net. Concretely, the browsing pathway scans the entire video at a high frame rate to check the temporal consistency, while the scrutinizing pathway focuses on analyzing key frames of the video at a lower frame rate. Furthermore, an attention branch is introduced to improve the forgery detection ability of the scrutinizing pathway. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of Bita-Net on various popular face forensics detection datasets, including FaceForensics++, CelebDF, DeepfakeTIMIT and UADFV.","tags":["Facial Video Forgery Detection"],"title":"Bita-Net: Bi-temporal Attention Network for Facial Video Forgery Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianze Wei","Ran He","Zhenan Sun"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617783125,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617783125,"objectID":"47a259738a0e6303ad5c545b115b0857","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/wei-ijcb-2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-07T08:58:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wei-ijcb-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Cross-database recognition is still an unavoidable challenge when deploying an iris recognition system to a new environment. In the paper, we present a compromise problem that resembles the real-world scenario, named iris recognition with insufficient labeled samples. This new problem aims to improve the recognition performance by utilizing partially-or un-labeled data. To address the problem, we propose Contrastive Uncertainty Learning (CUL) by integrating the merits of uncertainty learning and contrastive self-supervised learning. CUL makes two efforts to learn a discriminative and robust feature representation. On the one hand, CUL explores the uncertain acquisition factors and adopts a probabilistic embedding to represent the iris image. In the probabilistic representation, the identity information and acquisition factors are disentangled into the mean and variance, avoiding the impact of uncertain acquisition factors on the identity information. On the other hand, CUL utilizes probabilistic embeddings to generate virtual positive and negative pairs. Then CUL builds its contrastive loss to group the similar samples closely and push the dissimilar samples apart. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CUL for iris recognition with insufficient labeled samples.","tags":["smart iris recognition"],"title":"Contrastive Uncertainty Learning for Iris Recognition with Insufficient Labeled Samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhenan Sun","He Ran","Wang Liang","Kan Meina","Feng Jianjiang","Zheng Fang","Zheng Weishi","Zuo Wangmeng","Kang Wenxiong","Deng Weihong","Zhang Jie","Han Hu","Shan Shiguang","Wang Yunlong","Ru Yiwei","Zhu Yuhao","Liu Yunfan","He Yong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1615450325,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615450325,"objectID":"0d416338513022475da63f53d30fc86b","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/sun-jig-2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-11T08:58:18Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-jig-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Biometrics, such as face, iris, and fingerprint recognition, have become digital identity proof for people to enter the “Internet of Everything” . For example, one may be asked to present the biometric identifier for unlocking mobile, passing access control at airports, rail stations, and paying at supermarkets or restaurants. Biometric recognition empowers a machine to automatically detect, capture, process, analyze, and recognize digital physiological or behavioral signals with advanced intelligence. Thus, biometrics requires interdisciplinary research of science and technology involving optical engineering, mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, machine learning, pattern recognition, computer vision, digital image processing, signal analysis, cognitive science, neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and information security. Biometrics is a typical and complex pattern recognition problem, which is a frontier research direction of artificial intelligence. In addition, biometric identification is a key development area of Chinese strategies, such as the Development Plan on the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence and the “Internet Plus” Action Plan. The development of biometric identification involves public interest, privacy, ethics, and law issues; thus, it has also attracted widespread attention from the society. This article systematically reviews the development status, emerging directions, existing problems, and feasible ideas of biometrics and comprehensively summarizes the research progress of face, iris, fingerprint, palm print, finger / palm vein, voiceprint, gait recognition, person reidentification, and multimodal biometric fusion. The overview of face recognition includes face detection, facial landmark localization, 2D face feature extraction and recognition, 3D face feature extraction and recognition, facial liveness detection, and face video based biological signal measurement. The overview of iris recognition includes iris image acquisition, iris segmentation and localization, iris liveness detection, iris image quality assessment, iris feature extraction, heterogeneous iris recognition, fusion of iris and other modalities, security problems of iris biometrics, and future trends of iris recognition. The overview of fingerprint recognition includes latent fingerprint recognition, fingerprint liveness detection, distorted fingerprint recognition, 3D fingerprint capturing, and challenges and trends of fingerprint biometrics. The overview of palm print recognition mainly introduces databases, feature models, matching strategies, and open problems of palm print biometrics. The overview of vein biometrics introduces main datasets and algorithms for finger vein, dorsal hand vein, and palm vein, and then points out the remaining unsolved problems and development trend of vein recognition. The overview of gait recognition introduces model-based and model-free methods for gait feature extraction and matching. The overview of person reidentification introduces research progress of new methods under supervised, unsupervised and weakly supervised conditions, gait database virtualization, generative gait models, and new problems, such as clothes changing, black clothes, and partial occlusions. The overview of voiceprint recognition introduces the history of speaker recognition, robustness of voiceprint, spoofing attacks, and antispoofing methods. The overview of multibiometrics introduces image-level, feature-level, score-level, and decision-level information fusion methods and deep learning based fusion approaches. Taking face as the exemplar biometric modality, new research directions that have received great attentions in the field of biometric recognition in recent years, i. e. , adversarial attack and defense as well as Deepfake and anti-Deepfake, are also introduced. Finally, we analyze and summarize the three major challenges in the field of biometric recognition——— “ the blind spot of biometric sensors”, “ the decision errors of biometric algorithms” and “the red zone of biometric security” . Therefore, the sensing, cognition, and security mechanisms of biometrics are necessary to achieve a fundamental breakthrough in the academic research and technologies applications of biometrics in complex scenarios to address the shortcomings of the existing biometric technologies and to move towards the overall goal of developing a new generation of “ perceptible, “ robust”, and “ trustworthy” biometric identification technology.","tags":["smart iris recognition"],"title":"Overview of biometrics research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Over the years, numerous face databases have been published that brought about exciting breakthrough in the facial biometric research field, most especially from the recent trend of deep learning contributions. However, as investigated by researchers, most of these databases are demographically imbalanced and often contain few number of African cohorts. Of those with relatively large number of the Africans, the databases are usually wild (downloaded from the internet or digitalised from printed photographs). Methods that adopt these skewed databases often exhibits some form of performance bias that can result to unintended consequences for real time applications. As such, there is need for more demographically inclusive datasets. CASIA-Face-Africa is developed to provide solution to this problem. It is an all-African database that is made to be used as a complementary database with the existing databases to balance the number of the African cohorts in the published datasets and improve their demographic inclusiveness.\nDESCRIPTION The database images were captured at various locations in Nigeria, Africa. About 1150 volunteers participated in the capturing exercise. The images of each subject were captured concurrently using 3 cameras. Two visible wavelength (VW) cameras and one near-infrared (NIR) camera. The capturing was done in various sessions over a period of 3 months. Some of the subjects have images captured in multiple sessions while majority of the subjects have their images captured in a single session. Figure 1: The cameras arrangement set-up was made to be same in all the capturing sessions\nFor each capturing instance, 3 to 10 still images were captured by each camera at a fixed time interval of 1 to 3 seconds. For some subjects, an external illumination light source was used for capturing additional images of that subjects. Also, some subjects were asked to use face accessory such as eye glasses for multiple capturing. The captured images were then organized and their land mark labelled. The organized database comprises a total of 38,546 images from 1,183 subjects. Specifically, 12,063 images captured by VW camera 1 at the resolution of 1332×1080, 13,232 images are captured by VW camera 2 at the resolution of 787 × 962, and 13,251 images are captured by NIR camera at the resolution of 983 × 877. Some samples of the captured images are shown in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 2: Sample of a single subject images\nFigure 3: Sample of subject Expressions\nFigure 4: Sample of labelled face images\nDatabase Organization The database package comprises of the following components organised in multiple directories:\nImages folder: This contain the actual face images. Each file is named as SubjectID_ImageNumber.jpg. The SubjectID is a unique number for each subject and the ImageNumber is a sequential number for images of the same subject. Subjects folder: This contain the corresponding ini files that describe the unique subjects in the images. Each file is named with the ID of the subject as SubjectID.ini. Attributes folder: This contain the corresponding ini files that describes each individual face image. Each file is named with its corresponding face image name as SubjectID_ImageNumber.ini Protocols folder: This contain the files named with each of the defined proposed protocols. Example of the names: ID-V-All-Ep1.ini, ID-I-Split-Ep3.ini, etc. Each of the files contains list of all the images allowed to be used for that protocol which are categorised as either Training, Testing, Target or Query as described in the database paper. Codes folder: These are evaluation codes in multiple programming languages that can be used to easily adopt the database for various applications.

\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;虹膜识别是最具潜力的生物识别方法之一，是识别率高、非接触性、防欺骗性好的识别方法。虹膜属于人眼的一部分，如下图所示。 \u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;人眼的外观主要由巩膜、虹膜、瞳孔三部分组成，其中巩膜即眼球外围的白色部分，约占人眼总面积的30%，眼睛的中心为瞳孔部分，约占5%，虹膜位于巩膜和瞳孔之间，约占整个眼睛的65%，包含了最丰富的纹理信息，外观上看，虹膜由许多腺窝、褶皱、色素斑等构成，是人体中最独特的结构之一。因为瞳孔、虹膜和巩膜一般颜色不同，灰度值呈梯度变化，所以根据它们灰度不同，可以将它们明显分开。从几何形状可以看出，虹膜的内、外边界可以近似为圆形，这使它具有易检测性。临床观察发现：虹膜在人的一生当中几乎不发生变化，只有很少的虹膜纹理可能会由于年龄或者外伤导致纹理破坏。 \u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;作为表示个人身份的标识物，必须具备作为身份标识的重要特征。人脸、指纹等许多生物特征具有作为身份标识的特性，但是，虹膜在这些特性方面表现的更为突出，具有许多先天优势，是其他生物特征无法与之媲美的。 普遍性————虹膜是每个人天生都具有的。唯一性————虹膜的纤维组织细节复杂而丰富，每个人错综复杂的虹膜独一无二，只与虹膜的形成过程有关。稳定性————虹膜从婴儿胚胎发育的第三个月起开始发育，到第八个月虹膜的主要纹理结构已经成形。非入侵检测————从一定距离即可获得虹膜数字图像，无需用户接触设备。可接受程度好————虹膜识别以其认证准确度高、速度快、安全性高，被用户所接受。可检测性————利用图像处理技术检测出虹膜边界，易于拟合分割和和归一化防伪性高————虹膜的半径小，在可见光下中国人的虹膜图像呈现深褐色，看不到纹理信息，需要虹膜图像专业采集设备和用户的配合，所以一般情况下很难被盗取防欺骗性好————虹膜的唯一性决定了不同人眼的虹膜很难被冒充模仿。 \u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;生物特征识别通过捕获生物样本，然后采用数学方法把样本转化成相同大小的模板，提取有效的可区别性特征，就可以客观地和其他一个完整的虹膜身份识别系统主要由四个部分组成：虹膜图像获取、虹膜图像预处理、虹膜特征提取、模式比对。 虹膜图像获取 \u0026emsp;虹膜图像采集的目的是为了获取有效的虹膜图像，在传统的虹膜识别场景中，通常采用专业的成像装置在近红外光（波长700nm到900nm）照射和用户的配合下才能捕获清晰的高分辨率虹膜图像。近些年来，随着光学镜头、传感器和计算成像技术等的发展，虹膜识别的可用距离不断变大，相关装置也变得越来越轻巧实用，“远距离”、“行进中”、“移动端”和“可见光下”等少约束场景的虹膜识别对于用户使用时的约束越来越少，极大地提升了虹膜识别应用范围和用户友好性。 虹膜图像预处理 虹膜图像除了必须的虹膜区域以外，也包含了诸如巩膜、睫毛、瞳孔等非虹膜区域，因此不能直接用于虹膜识别。其次，一些噪声茹照明变化、睫毛遮挡、镜面反射、瞳孔放缩等会明显增加虹膜的类内差异，降低虹膜的识别率。常规的虹膜预处理步骤包括：虹膜活体检测、虹膜图像质量评估、虹膜分割、虹膜归一化和虹膜图像增强。 虹膜图像特征分析 虹膜图像特征分析主要包含两部分：特征提取和对比分类。虹膜特征提取是指从归一化的虹膜图像中提取紧凑有区分的虹膜特征，然后使用计算机可以存储和读取的格式进行编码。虹膜比对和分类(或者称为匹配)是指将提取的虹膜特征编码和事先在数据库注册过的虹膜特征编码通过某种相似性度量比如汉明距离、余弦距离进行对比，计算相似性分数，依次确定用户身份。

\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;包括计算摄影（例如，人像模式和闪光反射）和增强现实效果（例如，虚拟化身）在内的大量实际应用程序都依赖于通过跟踪虹膜来估计眼睛位置。一旦获得了准确的虹膜跟踪，我们就可以确定从相机到用户的距离，而无需使用专用的深度传感器。反过来，这可以改善各种用例，从计算摄影到适当大小的眼镜和帽子的虚拟试戴，到根据视听者的距离采用字体大小的可用性增强。 由于有限的计算资源，可变的光照条件和遮挡物（例如头发或人斜视）的存在，虹膜跟踪是在移动设备上解决的一项艰巨任务。通常，会使用复杂的专用硬件，从而限制了可在其中应用该解决方案的设备范围。 由MediaPipe Iris实现的眼睛重新着色示例 \u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;谷歌日前发布了用于精确虹膜估计的全新机器学习模型：MediaPipe Iris。所述模型以MediaPipe Face Mesh的研究作为基础，而它无需专用硬件就能够通过单个RGB摄像头实时追踪涉及虹膜，瞳孔和眼睛轮廓的界标。利用虹膜界标，模型同时能够在不使用深度传感器的情况下以相对误差小于10％的精度确定对象和摄像头之间的度量距离。请注意，虹膜追踪不会推断人们正在注视的位置，同时不能提供任何形式的身份识别。MediaPipe是一个旨在帮助研究人员和开发者构建世界级机器学习解决方案与应用程序的开源跨平台框架，所以在MediaPipe中实现的这一系统能够支持大多数现代智能手机，PC，笔记本电脑，甚至是Web。 用于远视用户的可用性原型：无论距离如何、字体大小能够保持恒定 1. 用于虹膜追踪的机器学习管道\n谷歌介绍道，开发系统的第一步利用了之前针对3D Face Meshes的研究，亦即通过高保真面部界标来生成近似面部几何形状的网格。根据所述网格，研究人员分离出原始图像中的眼睛区域以用于虹膜追踪模型。然后，谷歌将问题分为两个部分：眼睛轮廓估计和虹膜位置。他们设计了一个由一元化编码器组成的多任务模型，每个组件对应一个任务，这样就能够使用特定于任务的训练数据。\n用于远视用户的可用性原型：无论距离如何、字体大小能够保持恒定 \u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;为了将裁剪后的眼睛区域用于模型训练，团队手动注释了大约50万张图像。其中，图像涵盖了不同地理位置的各种照明条件和头部姿势，如下所示 用于远视用户的可用性原型：无论距离如何、字体大小能够保持恒定 裁剪的眼睛区域形成模型的输入，而它将通过单独的组件预测界标 2. 虹膜深度：用单个图像进行深度估计 无需任何专门的硬件，这个虹膜追踪模型能够以不到10％的误差确定对象到摄像头的度量距离。相关的原理事实是，人眼的水平直径虹膜基本恒定为11.7±0.5毫米。作为说明，请想象将针孔摄像头模型投影到正方形像素的传感器。你可以使用摄像头的焦距估计从面部界标到对象的距离，而这可以通过Camera Capture API或直接从捕获图像的EXIF元数据，以及其他摄像头固有参数进行获取。给定焦距，对象到摄像头的距离与对象眼睛的物理尺寸成正比，如下图所示\n利用类似的三角形，我们可以根据焦距（f）和虹膜大小来计算对象的距离（d） 左边：在Pixel 2运行的MediaPipe Iris正在以cm为单位估计度量距离，没有采用任何深度摄像头；右边：groud-truth深度 \u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;为了量化所述方法的精确性，研究人员收集了200多位被试的正向同步视频和深度图像，并将其与iPhone 11的深度传感器进行比较。团队使用激光测距设备，通过实验确定iPhone 11的深度传感器在2米以内的误差小于2％。对于使用虹膜大小进行深度估算的方法，平均相对误差为4.3％，标准偏差是2.4％。谷歌对有眼镜被试和正常视力被试（不计入隐形眼镜情况）测试了所述方法，并发现眼镜会将平均相对误差略微提高到4.8％（标准偏差是3.1％）。另外，实验没有测试存在任何眼睛疾病的被试。考虑到MediaPipe Iris不需要专门的硬件，所述结果表明系统能够支持一系列成本范围的设备根据单张图像获取度量深度 估计误差的直方图（左边），以及实际和估计距离的比较（右边） 3. 发布MediaPipe Iris\n\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;这个虹膜和深度估计模型将作为支持PC，移动设备和Web的跨平台MediaPipe管道发布。正如谷歌在最近一篇关于MediaPipe的博文所述，团队利用WebAssembly和XNNPACK在浏览器中本地运行Iris ML管道，无需将任何数据发送到云端。 使用MediaPipe的WASM堆栈。你可以在浏览器种运行模型 仅使用包含EXIF数据的单张图片计算虹膜深度 4. 未来方向\n\u0026emsp;\u0026emsp;谷歌计划进一步扩展MediaPipe Iris模型，实现更稳定的追踪性能以降低误差，并将其部署用于无障碍用例。谷歌在相关文档和随附的Model Card中详细说明了预期的用途，限制和模型的公平性，从而确保模型的使用符合谷歌的AI原则。请注意，任何形式的监视监控都明显超出应用范围，故不予支持。团队表示：“我们希望的是，通过向广泛的研究与开发社区提供这种虹膜感知功能，从而促使创造性用例的出现，激发负责任的新应用和新研究途径。”","date":1596844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596844800,"objectID":"81cf5b1dee52c3a2704cf032b84764b9","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/post/mediapipe-iris/","publishdate":"2020-08-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mediapipe-iris/","section":"post","summary":"Real

Introduction With the pronounced need for reliable personal identification, iris recognition has become an important enabling technology in our society. Although an iris pattern is naturally an ideal identifier, the development of a high-performance iris recognition algorithm and transferring it from research lab to practical applications is still a challenging task. Automatic iris recognition has to face unpredictable variations of iris images in real-world applications. For example, recognition of iris images of poor quality, nonlinearly deformed iris images, iris images at a distance, iris images on the move, and faked iris images all are open problems in iris recognition. A basic work to solve the problems is to design and develop a high quality iris image database including all these variations. Moreover, a novel iris image database may help identify some frontier problems in iris recognition and leads to a new generation of iris recognition technology.\nCASIA Iris Image Database (CASIA-Iris) developed by our research group has been released to the international biometrics community and updated from CASIA-IrisV1 to CASIA-IrisV3 since 2002. More than 3,000 users from 70 countries or regions have downloaded CASIA-Iris and much excellent work on iris recognition has been done based on these iris image databases. Although great progress of iris recognition has been achieved since 1990s, the rapid growth of iris recognition applications has clearly highlighted two challenges, i.e. usability and scalability.\nUsability is the largest bottleneck of current iris recognition. It is a trend to develop long-range iris image acquisition systems for friendly user authentication. However, iris images captured at a distance are more challenging than traditional close-up iris images. Lack of long-range iris image data in the public domain has hindered the research and development of next-generation iris recognition systems.\nMost current iris recognition methods have been typically evaluated on medium sized iris image databases with a few hundreds of subjects. However, more and more large-scale iris recognition systems are deployed in real-world applications. Many new problems are met in classification and indexing of large-scale iris image databases. So scalability is another challenging issue in iris recognition.\nIn order to promote research on long-range and large-scale iris recognition systems, we are pleased to release to the public domain CASIA Iris Image Database V4.0 (or CASIA-IrisV4 for short).\n2. Brief Descriptions and Statistics of the Database CASIA-IrisV4 is an extension of CASIA-IrisV3 and contains six subsets. The three subsets from CASIA-IrisV3 are CASIA-Iris-Interval, CASIA-Iris-Lamp, and CASIA-Iris-Twins respectively. The three new subsets are CASIA-Iris-Distance, CASIA-Iris-Thousand, and CASIA-Iris-Syn.\nCASIA-IrisV4 contains a total of 54,601 iris images from more than 1,800 genuine subjects and 1,000 virtual subjects. All iris images are 8 bit gray-level JPEG files, collected under near infrared illumination or synthesized. Some statistics and features of each subset are given in Table 1. The six data sets were collected or synthesized at different times and CASIA-Iris-Interval, CASIA-Iris-Lamp, CASIA-Iris-Distance, CASIA-Iris-Thousand may have a small inter-subset overlap in subjects.\n2.1 CASIA-Iris-Interval Iris images of CASIA-Iris-Interval were captured with our self-developed close-up iris camera (Fig.1). The most compelling feature of our iris camera is that we have designed a circular NIR LED array, with suitable luminous flux for iris imaging. Because of this novel design, our iris camera can capture very clear iris images (see Fig.2). CASIA-Iris-Interval is well-suited for studying the detailed texture features of iris images.\nFig.1 The self-developed iris camera used for collection of CASIA-Iris-Interval Fig.2 Example iris images in CASIA-Iris-Interval\n2.2 CASIA-Iris-Lamp CASIA-Iris-Lamp was collected using a hand-held iris sensor produced by OKI (Fig.3). A lamp was turned on/off close to the subject to introduce more intra-class variations when we collected CASIA-Iris-Lamp. Elastic deformation of iris texture (Fig.4) due to pupil expansion and contraction under different illumination conditions is one of the most common and challenging issues in iris recognition. So CASIA-Iris-Lamp is good for studying problems of non-linear iris normalization and robust iris feature representation.\nFig.3 The hand-held iris camera used for collection of CASIA-Iris-Lamp Fig.4 Example iris images in CASIA-Iris-Lamp\n2.3 CASIA-Iris-Twins CASIA-Iris-Twins contains iris images of 100 pairs of twins, which were collected during Annual Twins Festival in Beijing using OKI\u0026rsquo;s IRISPASS-h camera (Fig.5). Although iris is usually regarded as a kind of phenotypic biometric characteristics and even twins have their unique iris patterns, it is interesting to study the dissimilarity and similarity between iris images of twins.\nFig.5 Example iris images in CASIA-Iris-Twins\n2.4 CASIA-Iris-Distance CASIA-Iris-Distance contains iris images captured using our self-developed long-range multi-modal biometric image acquisition and recognition system (LMBS, Fig.6). The advanced biometric sensor can recognize users from 3 meters away by actively searching iris, face or palmprint patterns in the visual field via an intelligent multi-camera imaging system. The LMBS is human-oriented by fusing computer vision, human computer interaction and multi-camera coordination technologies and improves greatly the usability of current biometric systems. The iris images of CASIA-Iris-Distance were captured by a high resolution camera so both dual-eye iris and face patterns are included in the image region of interest (Fig. 7). And detailed facial features such as skin pattern are also visible for multi-modal biometric information fusion.\nFig.6 The biometric sensor used for collection of CASIA-Iris-Distance Fig.7 An example image in CASIA-Iris-Distance\n2.5 CASIA-Iris-Thousand CASIA-Iris-Thousand contains 20,000 iris images from 1,000 subjects, which were collected using IKEMB-100 camera (Fig. 8) produced by IrisKing. IKEMB-100 is a dual-eye iris camera with friendly visual feedback, realizing the effect of “What You See Is What You Get”. The bounding boxes shown in the frontal LCD help users adjust their pose for high-quality iris image acquisition. The main sources of intra-class variations in CASIA-Iris-Thousand are eyeglasses and specular reflections. Since CASIA-Iris-Thousand is the first publicly available iris dataset with one thousand subjects, it is well-suited for studying the uniqueness of iris features and develop novel iris classification and indexing methods.\nFig.8 The iris camera used for collection of CASIA-Iris-Thousand Fig.9 An example image in CASIA-Iris-Thousand\n2.6 CASIA-Iris-Syn CASIA-Iris-Syn contains 10,000 synthesized iris images of 1,000 classes. The iris textures of these images are synthesized automatically from a subset of CASIA-IrisV1 with the approach described in [1] (Fig. 10). Then the iris ring regions were embedded into the real iris images, which makes the artificial iris images more realistic. The intra-class variations introduced into the synthesized iris dataset include deformation, blurring, and rotation, which raise a challenge problem for iris feature representation and matching. We have demonstrated in [1] that the synthesized iris images are visually realistic and most subjects can not distinguish genuine and artificial iris images. More importantly, the performance results tested on the synthesized iris image database have similar statistical characteristics to genuine iris database. So users of CASIA-IrisV4 are encouraged to use CASIA-Iris-Syn for iris recognition research and any suggestions are welcome. If CASIA-Iris-Syn proves to be successful for most researchers of iris recognition, we will provide more and more synthesized iris images in the future.\nFig. 10 Flowchart of the iris texture synthesis method for generation of CASIA-Iris-Syn Fig. 11 Example iris images in CASIA-Iris-Syn\n3.

LF cameras possess coherent abilities to capture multiple sub-aperture views (SAIs) within one exposure, which can provide appropriate multi-view sources for material recognition. In this paper, a unified Factorize-Connect-Merge (FCM) deep-learning pipeline is proposed to solve problems of light field image based material recognition. 4D light-field data as input is initially decomposed into consecutive 3D light-field slices. Shallow CNN is leveraged to extract low-level visual features of each view inside these slices. As to establish correspondences between these SAIs, Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network is built upon these low-level features to model the imaging differences. After feature selection including concatenation and dimension reduction, effective and robust feature representations for material recognition can be extracted from 4D light-field data. Experimental results indicate that the proposed pipeline can obtain remarkable performances on both tasks of single-pixel material classification and whole-image material segmentation. In addition, the proposed pipeline can potentially benefit and inspire other researchers who may also take LF images as input and need to extract 4D light-field representations for computer vision tasks such as object classification, semantic segmentation and edge detection.

However, limited angular resolution has become the main bottleneck of microlens-based plenoptic cameras towards more practical vision applications. Existing view synthesis methods mainly break the task into two steps, i.e. depth estimating and view warping, which are usually inefficient and produce artifacts over depth ambiguities. We have proposed an end-to-end deep learning framework named Pseudo 4DCNN to solve these problems in a conference paper. Rethinking on the overall paradigm, we further extend pseudo 4DCNN and propose a novel loss function which is applicable for all tasks of light field reconstruction i.e. EPI Structure Preserving (ESP) loss function. This loss function is proposed to attenuate the blurry edges and artifacts caused by averaging effect of L2 norm based loss function. Furthermore, the extended Pseudo 4DCNN is compared with recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on more publicly available light field databases, as well as self-captured light field biometrics and microscopy datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve better performances than vanilla Pseudo 4DCNN and other SOTA methods, especially in the terms of visual quality under occlusions.

In this paper, we propose a recognition-oriented quality metric and assessment method for iris image to deal with the problem. The method regards the iris image embeddings Distance in Feature Space (DFS) as the quality metric and the prediction is based on deep neural networks with the attention mechanism. The quality metric proposed in this paper can significantly improve the performance of the recognition algorithm while reducing the number of images discarded for recognition, which is advantageous over hand-crafted factors based iris quality assessment methods. The relationship between Image Rejection Rate (IRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER) is proposed to evaluate the performance of the quality assessment algorithm under the same image quality distribution and the same recognition algorithm.

In this paper, we explore binocular SV and LF imaging to form the binocular-LF imaging system. An imaging theory is derived by modeling the imaging process and analyzing disparity properties based on the geometrical optics theory. Then an accurate occlusion-robust depth estimation algorithm is proposed by exploiting multibaseline stereo matching cues and defocus cues.

Convolutional features onto certain regions are re-crafted by a graph generator to establish the connections among the spatial parts of biometrics and build Feature Graphs based on these node representations. Each node of Feature Graphs corresponds to a specific part of the input image and the edges express the spatial relationships between parts.

For example, free movement of head pose may cause large rotation difference between iris images. And illumination variations may cause irregular distortion of iris texture. To match intra-class iris images with head rotation robustly, the existing soadminlutions usually need a precise alignment operation by exhaustive search within a determined range in iris image preprosessing or brute-force searching the minimum Hamming distance in iris feature matching. In the wild enviroments, iris rotation is of much greater uncertainty than that in constrained situations and exhaustive search within a determined range is impracticable. This paper presents a unified feature-level solution to both alignment free and distortion robust iris recognition in the wild. A new deep learning based method named Alignment Free Iris Network (AFINet) is  proposed, which utilizes a trainable VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) encoder called NetVLAD [18] to decouple the correlations between local representations and their spatial positions. And deformable convolution [5] is leveraged to overcome iris texture distortion by dense adaptive sampling. The results of extensive experiments on three public iris image databases and the simulated degradation databases show that AFINet significantly outperforms state-of-art iris recognition methods.","tags":null,"title":"Alignment Free and Distortion Robust Iris Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianze Wei","Yunlong Wang","Xiang Wu","Zhaofeng  He","Ran He","Zhenan Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"4ef9c0699a3577c43bd7614ef612239c","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/csin-btas-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T11:44:49.305472Z","relpermalink":"/publication/csin-btas-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Due to the growing demand of iris biometrics, lots of new sensors are being developed for high-quality image acquisition. However, upgrading the sensor and re-enrolling for users is expensive and time-consuming. This leads to a dilemma where enrolling on one type of sensor but recognizing on the others. For this cross-sensor matching, the large gap between distributions of enrolling and recognizing images usually results in degradation in recognition performance. To alleviate this degradation, we propose Cross-sensor iris network (CSIN) by applying the adversarial strategy and weakening interference of sensor-specific information. Specifically, there are three valuable efforts towards learning discriminative iris features. Firstly, the proposed CSIN adds extra feature extractors to generate residual components containing sensor-specific information and then utilizes these components to narrow the distribution gap. Secondly, an adversarial strategy is borrowed from Generative Adversarial Networks to align feature distributions and further reduce the discrepancy of images caused by sensors. Finally, we extend triplet loss and propose instance-anchor loss to pull the instances of the same class together and push away from others. It is worth mentioning that the proposed method doesn’t need pair-same data or triplet, which reduced the cost of data preparation. Experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in cross-sensor iris recognition.","tags":null,"title":"Cross-sensor iris recognition using adversarial strategy and sensor-specific information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunlong Wang","Fei Liu","Kunbo Zhang","Guangqi Hou","Zhenan Sun","Tieniu Tan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"eb4d0743b49b915838e1c049f782c32d","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/wang-tip-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T11:44:49.308464Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-tip-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The low spatial resolution of light-field image poses significant difficulties in exploiting its advantage. To mitigate the dependency of accurate depth or disparity information as priors for light-field image super-resolution, we propose an implicitly multi-scale fusion scheme to accumulate contextual information from multiple scales for super-resolution reconstruction. The implicitly multi-scale fusion scheme is then incorporated into bidirectional recurrent convolutional neural network, which aims to iteratively model spatial relations between horizontally or vertically adjacent sub-aperture images of light-field data.

The security risk of iris recognition is increasing rapidly because of the attack by various patterns of fake iris. A German hacker organization called Chaos Computer Club cracked the iris recognition system of Samsung Galaxy S8 recently. In view of these risks, iris liveness detection has shown its significant importance to iris recognition systems. The state-of-the-art algorithms mainly rely on hand-crafted texture features which can only identify fake iris images with single pattern. In this paper, we proposed a Hierarchical Multiclass Iris Classification (HMC) for liveness detection based on CNN. HMC mainly focuses on iris liveness detection of multipattern fake iris. The proposed method learns the features of different fake iris patterns by CNN and classifies the genuine or fake iris images by hierarchical multi-class classification. This classification takes various characteristics of different fake iris patterns into account. All kinds of fake iris patterns are divided into two categories by their fake areas. The process is designed as two steps to identify two categories of fake iris images respectively. Experimental results demonstrate an extremely higher accuracy of iris liveness detection than other state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed HMC remarkably achieves the best results with nearly 100% accuracy on NDContact, CASIA-Iris-Interval, CASIA-Iris-Syn and LivDetIris-2017-Warsaw datasets. The method also achieves the best results with 100% accuracy on a hybrid dataset which consists of ND-Contact and LivDet-Iris-2017-Warsaw dataset","tags":["Iris-liveness-detection"],"title":"Hierarchical Multi-class Iris Classification for Liveness Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunlong Wang","Fei Liu","Zilei Wang","Guangqi Hou","Zhenan Sun","Tieniu Tan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"7ea1d1915c9430ad95008a9a2d7ba623","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/wang-eccv-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-16T11:44:49.306438Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-eccv-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Limited angular resolution has become the main bottleneck of microlens-based plenoptic cameras towards practical vision applications.

Specifically, 2D strided convolutions operated on stacked EPIs and detail-restoration 3D CNNs connected with angular conversion are assembled to build the Pseudo 4DCNN. The key advantage is to efficiently synthesize dense 4D light fields from a sparse set of input views. The learning framework is well formulated as an entirely trainable problem, and all the weights can be recursively updated with standard backpropagation. The proposed framework is compared with state-of-the-art approaches on both genuine and synthetic light field databases, which achieves significant improvements of both image quality (+2 dB higher) and computational efficiency (over 10X faster). Furthermore, the proposed framework shows good performances in real-world applications such as biometrics and depth estimation.","tags":["Computational Photography","Deep Learning","Light Field Reconstruction","End-to-end View Synthesis","Pseudo 4DCNN"],"title":"End-to-End View Synthesis for Light Field Imaging with Pseudo 4DCNN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Min Ren","Lingxiao He","Haiqing Li","Yunfan Liu","Zhenan Sun","Tieniu Tan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1500508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500508800,"objectID":"d536e7e8dd5e6fb4e646edaaaa38a4dd","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/publication/ren-ccbr-2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ren-ccbr-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we study the problem of partial person reidentification (re-id).

The space of all possible light rays is given by the five-dimensional plenoptic function, and the magnitude of each ray is given by the radiance. Michael Faraday was the first to propose (in an 1846 lecture entitled \u0026ldquo;Thoughts on Ray Vibrations\u0026rdquo;) that light should be interpreted as a field, much like the magnetic fields on which he had been working for several years. The phrase light field was coined by Andrey Gershun in a classic paper on the radiometric properties of light in three-dimensional space (1936).\nThe 4D light field In a plenoptic function, if the region of interest contains a concave object (think of a cupped hand), then light leaving one point on the object may travel only a short distance before being blocked by another point on the object. No practical device could measure the function in such a region.\nHowever, if we restrict ourselves to locations outside the convex hull (think shrink-wrap) of the object, i.e. in free space, then we can measure the plenoptic function by taking many photos using a digital camera. Moreover, in this case the function contains redundant information, because the radiance along a ray remains constant from point to point along its length, as shown at left. In fact, the redundant information is exactly one dimension, leaving us with a four-dimensional function (that is, a function of points in a particular four-dimensional manifold). Parry Moon dubbed this function the photic field (1981), while researchers in computer graphics call it the 4D light field (Levoy 1996) or Lumigraph (Gortler 1996). Formally, the 4D light field is defined as radiance along rays in empty space.\nThe set of rays in a light field can be parameterized in a variety of ways, a few of which are shown below. Of these, the most common is the two-plane parameterization shown at right (below). While this parameterization cannot represent all rays, for example rays parallel to the two planes if the planes are parallel to each other, it has the advantage of relating closely to the analytic geometry of perspective imaging. Indeed, a simple way to think about a two-plane light field is as a collection of perspective images of the st plane (and any objects that may lie astride or beyond it), each taken from an observer position on the uv plane. A light field parameterized this way is sometimes called a light slab.\nWays to create light fields Light fields are a fundamental representation for light. As such, there are as many ways of creating light fields as there are computer programs capable of creating images or instruments capable of capturing them.\nIn computer graphics, light fields are typically produced either by rendering a 3D model or by photographing a real scene. In either case, to produce a light field views must be obtained for a large collection of viewpoints. Depending on the parameterization employed, this collection will typically span some portion of a line, circle, plane, sphere, or other shape, although unstructured collections of viewpoints are also possible (Buehler 2001).\nDevices for capturing light fields photographically may include a moving handheld camera or a robotically controlled camera (Levoy 2002), an arc of cameras (as in the bullet time effect used in The Matrix), a dense array of cameras (Kanade 1998; Yang 2002; Wilburn 2005), handheld cameras (Ng 2005; Georgiev 2006; Marwah 2013), microscopes (Levoy 2006), or other optical system (Bolles 1987).\nHow many images should be in a light field? The largest known light field (of Michelangelo\u0026rsquo;s statue of Night) contains 24,000 1.3-megapixel images. At a deeper level, the answer depends on the application. For light field rendering (see the Application section below), if you want to walk completely around an opaque object, then of course you need to photograph its back side. Less obviously, if you want to walk close to the object, and the object lies astride the st plane, then you need images taken at finely spaced positions on the uv plane (in the two-plane parameterization shown above), which is now behind you, and these images need to have high spatial resolution.\nThe number and arrangement of images in a light field, and the resolution of each image, are together called the \u0026ldquo;sampling\u0026rdquo; of the 4D light field. Analyses of light field sampling have been undertaken by many researchers; a good starting point is Chai (2000). Also of interest is Durand (2005) for the effects of occlusion, Ramamoorthi (2006) for the effects of lighting and reflection, and Ng (2005) and Zwicker (2006) for applications to plenoptic cameras and 3D displays, respectively.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"f3939b65ca5c42e2fb3f6da617eea401","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/project/light-field-photography/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/light-field-photography/","section":"project","summary":"Light field is a parameterized representation of four-dimensional radiation field which contains both position and direction information in space","tags":["Light Field Photography"],"title":"Light Field Photography","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"ca512dce072f572757e9d9864616a179","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/benchmark/periocular-recognition/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/benchmark/periocular-recognition/","section":"benchmark","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Ocular Recognition"],"title":"Periocular Recognition","type":"benchmark"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"To be updated.....","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"ac06c4cd588437d58836c7231f598f37","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/project/periocular-recognition/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/periocular-recognition/","section":"project","summary":"Face recognition derivative, periocular recognition","tags":["Ocular Recognition"],"title":"Periocular Recognition","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"51f301e55709d9e7c1f85ba49df9fc22","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/benchmark/sclera-recognition/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/benchmark/sclera-recognition/","section":"benchmark","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Ocular Recognition"],"title":"Sclera Recognition","type":"benchmark"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"To be updated.....","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"b6c4b4b975d4de2d1e4d92dadf9663ae","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/project/sclera-recognition/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sclera-recognition/","section":"project","summary":"Another ocular biometric after iris biometrics","tags":["Ocular Recognition"],"title":"Sclera Recognition","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In this paper, we design a novel optical sensing system to directly acquire the depth map of the scene from one light-field camera. The light-field sensing system can count the number of people crossing the passageway, and record the direction and intensity of rays at a snapshot without any assistant light devices. Depth maps are extracted from the raw light-ray sensing data. Our smart sensing system is equipped with a passive imaging sensor, which is able to naturally discern the depth difference between the head and shoulders for each person. Then a human model is built. Through detecting the human model from light-field images, the number of people passing the scene can be counted rapidly. We verify the feasibility of the sensing system as well as the accuracy by capturing real-world scenes passing single and multiple people under natural illumination.","tags":["Light field photography","RGB-D sensor","People Counting"],"title":"4D light-field sensing system for people counting","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0e6de1a61aa83269ff13324f3167c1a9","permalink":"https://hycasia.github.io/slides/example/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/slides/example/","section":"slides","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"slides"}]
